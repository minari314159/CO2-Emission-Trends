Global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at a time when they need to be rapidly falling.

To effectively reduce emissions, we need to know where they come from – which sectors contribute the most? How can we use this understanding to develop effective solutions and mitigation strategies?

The following data includes the breakdown of emissions – total greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide individually – by sector and country. 

This analysis and visualizations will focus on Canada. Canadians generally have the atitude that Canada is a very environmentally friendly country due to its emmense amount of land and nature as well as "green" government policies. Here these ideas will quantitatively be questioned, comparing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions to the worlds by industrial sector.
